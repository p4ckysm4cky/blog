I’m starting this blog, so that I can write down the steps I did to solve certain issues and maybe talk about things I found interesting. Hopefully this will help me improve my writing skills haha and maybe someone on the internet will find it useful.Upcoming posts (?)I recently encountered an issue with my server: Dell R610.The servers comes with IDRAC6 (Dell Remote Access Controller), which essentially allows you to keep track of the status of the server and remotely perform actions through IPMI or Web interface. However, recently I realised that I couldn’t access the web interface, but could only SSH to the chip. So hopefully in the future I’m able to post how I managed to fix the issue." } ]
