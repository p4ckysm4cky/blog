## Introduction:

Hi, I recently got back into home servers after neglecting it for almost a whole year. I'm starting this blog, so that I can write down the steps I did to solve certain issues and maybe talk about things I found interesting. Hopefully this will help me improve my writing skills haha and maybe someone on the internet will find it useful.



## Upcoming posts (?)

I recently encountered an issue with my server: Dell R610.

The servers comes with **IDRAC6** (Dell Remote Access Controller), which essentially allows you to keep track of the status of the server and remotely perform actions through IPMI or Web interface. However, recently I realised that I couldn't access the web interface, but could only SSH to the chip. So hopefully in the future I'm able to post how I managed to fix the issue.
